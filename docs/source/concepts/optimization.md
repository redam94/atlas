# Optimization

## Overview

Optimization is the decision engine that finds the best possible actions given your predictions, constraints, and objectives. In Atlas, optimization goes beyond simple maximization or minimization - it's about navigating complex tradeoffs, balancing multiple objectives, and finding solutions that work in the real world. The framework provides multiple optimization approaches, each suited to different types of business challenges.

## What is Optimization?

At its core, optimization answers the question: "Given what we know and what we can control, what should we do to achieve the best outcome?"

This involves:
- **Exploring Possibilities**: Evaluating thousands or millions of potential decisions
- **Balancing Tradeoffs**: Managing competing objectives like growth vs. profitability
- **Respecting Limits**: Working within budgets, capacities, and business rules
- **Finding Robustness**: Ensuring solutions work under uncertainty

Atlas makes this complex process accessible to business users while providing advanced capabilities for technical teams.

## The Optimization Landscape

### Different Problems, Different Approaches

Not all optimization problems are created equal. Atlas recognizes this by offering multiple optimization engines:

**Mathematical Programming**: When relationships are well-understood and linear or convex
**Heuristic Search**: When the problem is too complex for exact solutions
**Bayesian Optimization**: When model evaluations are expensive
**Evolutionary Algorithms**: When exploring creative, non-obvious solutions

The framework automatically helps select the right approach, or you can specify based on your expertise.

### Single vs. Multi-Objective

Real business decisions rarely involve a single goal:
- Maximize revenue AND minimize cost
- Increase market share AND maintain profitability  
- Improve service levels AND reduce inventory
- Grow new customers AND retain existing ones

Atlas excels at multi-objective optimization, helping you understand and navigate these tradeoffs.

## How Optimization Works

### The Search Process

Imagine you're allocating a marketing budget across channels. The optimization process:

1. **Starts with an Initial Allocation**: Perhaps last year's budget
2. **Explores Variations**: What if we spent more on digital, less on TV?
3. **Evaluates Each Option**: Uses your model to predict outcomes
4. **Identifies Improvements**: Finds allocations with better results
5. **Continues Searching**: Iterates until no better solution exists

This happens automatically, with Atlas handling the complexity behind the scenes.

### Intelligent Exploration

Modern optimization is smart about where to search:
- **Gradient Information**: Following the "slope" toward better solutions
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Learning which areas are promising
- **Constraint Awareness**: Avoiding infeasible regions
- **History Exploitation**: Learning from previous evaluations

This intelligence means finding great solutions in minutes instead of hours.

## Real-World Optimization Scenarios

### Marketing Budget Allocation

A consumer brand optimizes $100M annual marketing spend:

**Objectives**:
- Maximize revenue (primary goal)
- Build brand awareness (secondary goal)
- Maintain market share (constraint)

**Decisions**:
- How much to spend on each channel (TV, digital, print, radio)
- When to spend (seasonal timing)
- Where to spend (geographic allocation)

**Challenges**:
- Diminishing returns on each channel
- Synergies between channels
- Competitive responses
- Long-term brand effects

Atlas finds allocations that balance immediate sales with long-term brand building.

### Healthcare Staff Scheduling

A hospital optimizes nursing assignments:

**Objectives**:
- Minimize staffing costs
- Maximize patient satisfaction
- Ensure safe nurse-to-patient ratios

**Decisions**:
- Which nurses work which shifts
- How to handle surge capacity
- When to use overtime vs. temp staff

**Challenges**:
- Uncertain patient demand
- Staff preferences and constraints
- Skill matching requirements
- Regulatory compliance

The optimization balances efficiency with quality of care.

### Supply Chain Network Design

A retailer optimizes distribution network:

**Objectives**:
- Minimize total logistics cost
- Maintain service levels
- Reduce carbon footprint

**Decisions**:
- Where to locate distribution centers
- Which stores each center serves
- Inventory levels at each location

**Challenges**:
- Demand uncertainty
- Transportation constraints
- Facility capacities
- Service level requirements

Atlas finds network configurations that balance cost, service, and sustainability.

### Product Portfolio Optimization

A manufacturer optimizes product mix:

**Objectives**:
- Maximize profit margin
- Maintain production efficiency
- Meet market demand

**Decisions**:
- Which products to produce
- Production quantities
- Pricing strategies

**Challenges**:
- Limited production capacity
- Raw material constraints
- Market demand uncertainty
- Competitive dynamics

The framework navigates complex manufacturing and market constraints.

## Advanced Optimization Features

### Pareto Frontier Analysis

When objectives conflict, there's rarely a single "best" solution. Atlas identifies the Pareto frontier - the set of solutions where you can't improve one objective without sacrificing another. This helps stakeholders understand tradeoffs and make informed decisions.

### Scenario Optimization

The future is uncertain. Atlas can optimize across multiple scenarios:
- **Optimistic**: Everything goes well
- **Pessimistic**: Challenges arise
- **Most Likely**: Base case expectations

This produces robust solutions that perform well regardless of what happens.

### Rolling Horizon Optimization

For dynamic problems, Atlas supports rolling optimization:
- Make decisions for the near term
- Re-optimize as new information arrives
- Maintain consistency while adapting to change

This is ideal for problems like demand planning or campaign management.

### Warm Starting

When conditions change slightly, Atlas doesn't start from scratch. It uses previous solutions as starting points, finding new optima quickly. This enables real-time optimization for dynamic environments.

## Optimization Performance

### Speed Matters

Business decisions can't wait. Atlas accelerates optimization through:
- **Parallelization**: Exploring multiple solutions simultaneously
- **Caching**: Remembering previous evaluations
- **Early Stopping**: Recognizing when solutions are "good enough"
- **Approximation**: Trading small accuracy losses for large speed gains

### Scalability

From small problems to enterprise-scale challenges, Atlas scales:
- **Thousands of decision variables**
- **Millions of constraints**
- **Multiple objectives and scenarios**
- **Distributed computation when needed**

## Making Optimization Accessible

## Common Optimization Patterns

### Budget Allocation
Distributing limited resources across competing uses to maximize return.

### Scheduling
Assigning resources to tasks over time while respecting constraints.

### Network Flow
Moving products or information efficiently through a network.

### Portfolio Selection
Choosing the best mix of options given risk and return profiles.

### Capacity Planning
Sizing resources to meet demand while minimizing cost.

## Getting Started with Optimization

### Define Clear Objectives
What are you trying to achieve? Be specific about goals and their relative importance.

### Identify Decision Variables
What can you actually control? Focus on meaningful levers.

### Understand Constraints
What limits exist? Include both hard constraints and soft preferences.

### Start Simple
Begin with basic optimization and add complexity as you learn.

### Iterate and Refine
Use results to improve models, adjust constraints, and refine objectives.
